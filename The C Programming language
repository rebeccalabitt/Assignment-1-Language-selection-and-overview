The programming language I have chosen is the language C. It was invented at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to 
construct utilities running on Unix. C is a general-purpose, imperative language, supporting structured programming. C is a compiled language. C is 
mostly used for writing compupter applications, microcontrollers and operating systems. The three most popular projects on github written in C are as follows: 
1) cdr/code-server VS Code in the browser
2) styled-components/styled-components Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress ðŸ’…
3)serhii-londar/open-source-mac-os-apps ðŸš€ Awesome list of open source applications for macOS.
When it is time for me to start programming in C, I will use books and websites as resources. 
The websites and books I will use are as follows:
